Hi! This is the pilot episode for Spirits and Tongues!

Listen to figure out what this podcast is all about. (I mean, "Spirits and Tongues"?! What could that even be talking about?)

Maybe you'll laugh. Maybe you'll stick around for another episode or two. Maybe you'll have an existential crisis while considering the question of what it means to be a human.
