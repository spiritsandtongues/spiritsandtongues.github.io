I love my cats, with fur so soft and warm

<!--preview-cutoff-->

They bring me joy, with every purr and mew

From dawn till dusk, they're by my side

My loyal companions, on this homestead ride

...

With eyes like jewels, and tails held high

They roam the prairie, with wildcat pride

They chase the mice, and birds in flight

And bring me treasures, of their hunts at night

...

I love my cats, with their independent ways

They come and go, as they please, each day

But when they cuddle, close to my face

I know they love me, in their feline grace

...

With every scratch, and every nuzzle too

They show me love, in all they do

My heart is full, with these cats of mine

On this frontier, they make my life shine

...

So here's to you, my furry friends

May our bond never come to an end

For I love my cats, till the end of time

And they'll always be, a part of this heart of mine.
