When I was a young lass, my grandmother would often make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch. I loved the creamy peanut butter and the sweet jelly, but as I grew older, I found myself wanting something more exciting and grown-up. And so, I decided to take my beloved sandwich and elevate it to a whole new level by turning it into a kebab.

These kebabs are perfect for a summer BBQ, a picnic, or even as a fun and unique appetizer. They're easy to make and are sure to delight both children and adults alike.

**Ingredients:**

- 8 slices of white bread
- 1 cup of peanut butter
- 1 cup of jelly or jam (your favorite flavor)
- 8 skewers

**Instructions:**

1. Cut the crusts off the bread and then cut each slice into squares.
2. Spread peanut butter on half of the squares and jelly on the other half.
3. Put a peanut butter square and a jelly square together to make a sandwich.
4. Cut the sandwiches into small squares, about 1 inch each.
5. Thread the sandwich squares onto skewers, alternating between peanut butter and jelly squares.
6. Heat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.
7. Grill the kebabs for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are slightly toasted and the peanut butter and jelly are warm and melty.
8. Serve immediately and enjoy!

These kebabs are the perfect combination of sweet and savory flavors. The peanut butter and jelly are perfectly balanced and the toasted bread adds a delightful crunch. They're sure to be a hit at your next gathering, or simply as a fun and unique way to enjoy a classic sandwich.
