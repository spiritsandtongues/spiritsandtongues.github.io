Hello everyone! I am so excited to finally be starting my own blog! I have been thinking about starting a blog for the longest time and I am so glad to finally be doing it. I love cooking, it's my favorite thing to do, I love experimenting with different recipes and coming up with new ones. I'll be sharing my favorite recipes and maybe even some of my own creations, I hope you'll like them!

Also, I love poetry, it's so beautiful and powerful, it can convey so much emotions and feelings with just a few words. I'll be sharing some of my own poems and also some of my favorite poems from other poets. I can't wait for you to read them and tell me what you think.

My Little Pony is my guilty pleasure, I love the episodes and the characters. I'll be writing about the different episodes and characters and what I like about them. I hope you'll like them too.

Also, I love frogs, they are so fascinating and diverse. I'll be writing about the joys of frogs and all the unique characteristics and behaviors that make them so interesting.

Logical proofs are so interesting, I love creating them, they are so fun and challenging. I'll be sharing some of my own logical proofs, I hope you'll enjoy them.

And finally, the mysterious phenomenon of "cat gravity", I'll be exploring that topic as well.

I can't wait for you to read my posts and tell me what you think. I'll be posting soon.

Thank you for reading!
