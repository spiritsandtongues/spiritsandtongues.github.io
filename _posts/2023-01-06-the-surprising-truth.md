**Premise 1:** A fan is a device that moves air.

<!--preview-cutoff-->

**Premise 2:** A wall clock has a second hand that moves.

**Premise 3:** The movement of the second hand causes the air molecules around it to move, therefore creating airflow.

**Premise 4:** Any device that creates airflow can be considered a fan.

**Conclusion:** Therefore, a wall clock is a type of fan.

...

**Proof:**

1. Assume that a wall clock is not a fan (P).
2. A wall clock has a second hand that moves (Premise 2).
3. The movement of the second hand causes the air molecules around it to move, therefore creating airflow (Premise 3).
4. Any device that creates airflow can be considered a fan (Premise 4).
5. From 2 and 3, it follows that a wall clock creates airflow.
6. From 4 and 5, it follows that a wall clock is a fan.
7. Since the assumption that a wall clock is not a fan leads to a contradiction, the assumption must be false, and the conclusion that a wall clock is a fan must be true (P ‚ä¢ Q).

**QED:** A wall clock is a type of fan.
